# WEMExtractor
Tool for extracting audio from Kid A Mnesia. Uploaded because it might be of use for some other game that I don't know exists.

***Warning: I wrote this at 3-6 in the morning. It seems to be perfectly stable and work fine for my usecase. The code isn't great. I cant guarantee it'll work on any other WW/UE4 application.***

# Usage
Drop the folder containing .ubulk and .uexp files on to the executable file. It'll create a new folder called "Exported" with the WEM files in it.
